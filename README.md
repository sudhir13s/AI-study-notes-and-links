# A repository for all notes and links to study AI-ML
A repository to keep notes for myself as I tent to forget which resources I used for a better understanding of a topic.
So, the repo will contain links of any resources (YouTube videos, any courses, blogposts, research paper, etc.) used.

Below is a base structure. Will keep updating it.
